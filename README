ROTTEN NETFLIX v.4

Update Dec 26th 2012 --

I found this extention and saw that it wasn't being updated anymore. I took the liberty of getting it functioning again and adding in some new features. 

Changes:
  - Ajax request now hits the rottentomatoes API
  - Request made only when the movie shows up in the viewport
  - Audience ratings shown
  - Some styling changes to account for new netflix styles
  - Ability to filter out rotten movies
  - New icons

Wrote this Chrome and Safari Extension to overlay Rotten Tomatoes reviews on top of Netflix.

Wanted to also give credit to to Matt Blodgett (http://www.mattblodgett.com/2009/07/rotten-tomatoes-netflix-greasemonkey.html). 
He had the closest thing to what I was looking for (in that case it was a greasemonkey script that is a bit outdated). 
I re-used the portion of his code that translates movie names from Netflix, to the corresponding RT URL.

If you have questions contact me @nicolaerusan.
