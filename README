ROTTEN NETFLIX v.4

Update Dec 26th 2012 --

I found this extention and saw that it wasn't being updated anymore. I took the liberty of getting it functioning again
and adding in some new features. In addition to seeing both critic and audience rating laid over the box tops, you now
also have the option to filter out rotten movies. All original credit goes to @nicolaerusan.

=====================================================================================================
Wrote this Chrome and Safari Extension to overlay Rotten Tomatoes reviews on top of Netflix.

Wanted to also give credit to to Matt Blodgett (http://www.mattblodgett.com/2009/07/rotten-tomatoes-netflix-greasemonkey.html). 
He had the closest thing to what I was looking for (in that case it was a greasemonkey script that is a bit outdated). 
I re-used the portion of his code that translates movie names from Netflix, to the corresponding RT URL.

If you have questions contact me @nicolaerusan.
